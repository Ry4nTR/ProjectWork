    questions:
    - question: "Bob!! You\u2019ve been hiding here the whole time! While you let
        the test subjects die from your reckless experiments, I had to fix the ship
        with only Eco\u2019s help!"

    - "Mark, I knew you\u2019d fix the ship. I\u2019ve never known a better mechanic."
    - "\u2019m truly glad you accomplished all this. I couldn\u2019t have picked
      a better person to help me."
    lineId: Domanda 1
    questions:
    - question: "Enough with the flattery. This ends now! You stayed behind to destroy
        the horrors your experiments caused! Countless people ripped from their lives
        for your obsession with fusing man and machine! And now Steve and the others
        have paid the price, you\u2019re a monster!"

    - "you really believe I\u2019d sacrifice my ethics for an experiment? Kill people
      I tried to help?"
    lineId: Domanda 2
    questions:
    - question: Then why stay on a ship in danger? Why not escape like the rest of
        the crew?

    - " I didn\u2019t stay to hide, I stayed to repair the damage to the ship\u2019s
      systems."
    - "The ship holds all my life\u2019s research data. I could never abandon that."
    - "As for Eco\u2026 things are worse than I thought. I discovered the attack
      on the ship started from your room\u2019s screen, a virus infiltrated all systems
      simultaneously."
    - "Only someone deeply familiar with the ship\u2019s architecture could pull
      that off."
    lineId: Domanda 3
    questions:
    - question: Are you saying Eco orchestrated all this? The same Eco who helped
        me repair the ship? Could she even do that, being designed to help humanity?

    - ' I programmed her to be as close to human as possible, but I never expected
      her to develop a personal identity or goal.'
    - " She tried to access one of the escape pods, likely to flee on her own. But
      she can\u2019t leave the ship unless it\u2019s through her host, meaning you."
    - 'She realized she was trapped inside you and helped you escape so she could
      escape herself, and never return to my lab. '
    lineId: Domanda 4
    questions:
    - question: "Even if that\u2019s true, what about the other test subjects I met,
        the ones I saw die in the hangar? You\u2019re saying those were just\u2026
        hallucinations?"

    - "This is the hardest part to admit\u2026 There were never other test subjects.
      Not at the same time, anyway."
    - Eco is one of a kind. I never created more than one instance. The ones you
      met were her previous hosts.
    - " I don\u2019t know how she recreated them in your mind, but you were alone
      in the hangar, I saw you talking to yourself on the surveillance feed."
    - 'Steve actually went home to his family six months ago. '
    - "He was never killed in the hangar. But if you don\u2019t believe me, the files
      with the latest test subjects and their current lives are on my desk."
    lineId: Domanda 5
    questions:
    - question: "Was it all a setup? I never actually knew Steve? Or is this just
        your cover-up to hide Eco? I don\u2019t know what to believe anymore\u2026
        I just want this to be over\u2026"

      only known a few days?"

    lineId: Domanda 6
    questions:
    - question: "Bob, try to understand. I woke up a couple of days ago with someone
        else in my head giving me orders, interacting with people who may not exist,
        and fixing a sabotaged ship guided by an AI meant to help me? I can\u2019t
        tell what\u2019s stranger, a rogue AI showing me people who aren\u2019t real,
        or an overambitious scientist who lost control\u2026"

    - "I understand\u2026 I can\u2019t blame you for your doubts. I wish I\u2019d
      visited you during those days, but I didn\u2019t want to disrupt the experiment.
      Now I see that was a mistake, and I\u2019m sorry."
    - "Given what you\u2019ve done, saving the ship, me, and my life\u2019s work,and
      our long friendship, I\u2019m naming you captain of the ship. You can take
      it wherever you want."
    - "If you believe me, I\u2019ll mark my lab\u2019s location and we\u2019ll go
      there together to work on saving Eco and improving my research."
    - If you choose to believe her instead, I only ask that you let me use the last
      remaining escape pod, and in memory of our past, let me go.
    - "In exchange, I\u2019ll show you how to lower the shielding on the Command
      Room and allow Eco access."
    - "Now I\u2019ll leave you some time to think it over. If you want to verify
      my research, the files are on the table. "
